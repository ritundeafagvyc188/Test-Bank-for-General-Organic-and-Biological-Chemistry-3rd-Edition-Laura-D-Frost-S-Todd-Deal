  * General, Organic, and Biological Chemistry strengthens the evidenced strategy of integrating general, organic, and biological chemistry for a focused introduction to the fundamental connections between chemistry and life. The streamlined approach offers readers a clear path through the content over a single semester.
 
The Third Edition integrates essential topics more effectively than any text on the market, covering core concepts in each discipline in just 12 comprehensive chapters. Practical connections and applications show readers how to use their understanding of chemistry in everyday life and future health professions. With an emphasis on problem solving and critical thinking, the book promotes active and attentive learning, which now include NEW! media assets, Practicing the Concepts. Featuring coauthor Todd Deal, these 3 to 5 minute videos explore key concepts in general, organic, and biological chemistry that readers traditionally find difficult. Readers gain skills and deepen their knowledge as they watch the videos and then practice what they have learned with Pause & Predict problems and a series of follow up multiple-choice questions.



 The Third Edition places a greater emphasis on matching what professors teach in the classroom by increasing the coverage of biochemical applications in each chapter. A new design was created to highlight the career content in order to increase relevancy.
